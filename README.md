#Cloud-Based Monetization System

Overview
The Cloud-Based Monetization System utilizes live IP addresses to track individual views and compute the hosting costs, including Content Delivery Network (CDN) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), for a single movie. This system also identifies the most-viewed content from a specific location (country) and determines the preferred language of the audience.

Functionality
View Tracking: Utilizes live IP addresses to monitor individual views of movies hosted on the platform.
Cost Calculation: Computes the hosting expenses, incorporating CDN and S3 costs, for each movie based on its viewership.
Geolocation Analysis: Identifies the most-viewed content within a particular country, enabling targeted content delivery strategies.
Language Preference Detection: Determines the preferred language of the audience, facilitating language-specific content recommendations and localization efforts.
Implementation
The system is implemented using modern cloud-based technologies and services, ensuring scalability, reliability, and efficiency. Key components of the implementation include:

IP Address Tracking: Utilizes IP address tracking mechanisms to capture individual viewer data.
Cost Calculation Algorithm: Employs algorithms to accurately compute hosting costs for each movie.
Geolocation Services: Integrates geolocation services to analyze viewer distribution by country.
Language Detection Mechanism: Incorporates language detection mechanisms to identify the preferred language of viewers.
Usage
To utilize the Cloud-Based Monetization System, follow these steps:

Setup: Configure the system with appropriate credentials and configurations for CDN and S3 services.
Integration: Integrate the system into your video streaming platform or content delivery infrastructure.
Monitoring: Regularly monitor system performance and cost metrics to optimize resource utilization.
Analysis: Analyze viewer data, geolocation insights, and language preferences to inform content strategies and monetization efforts.
